      Hello! My name is <strong>Erin Song</strong>, and I use she/her pronouns. I'm a senior from Kamiak High School.
      After I graduate from Kamiak, I plan to pursue an education in the tech field. In my free time, I like to try new
      coffee, play with my dog, and watch Studio Ghibli movies.
